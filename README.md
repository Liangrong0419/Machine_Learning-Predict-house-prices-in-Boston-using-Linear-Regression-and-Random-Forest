# Machine_Learning: Predict House Prices in Boston using Linear Regression and RandomForest
Boston is a bright, bustling modern city, but one steeped in significant history. It might not be the United States' or even Massachusetts’ oldest colony – it was settled by the British in 1630 – but it certainly proved significant in igniting the War of Independence in 1775, which ousted British rule, allowing the formation of the United States of America one year later.
